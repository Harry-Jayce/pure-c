printf is a very complicated problem.

many people think printf is not perfect.

it is not safe.
it should remember the format-symbol to progammers,
and it often is a unnesssary thing.

it is not good, but useful in the hardware interface layer.

the most defect of printf is the runtime error.

printf will not check if the format-string is match to the input value-box.

so it could happen many errors for the mismatch string problem.

the only solution is, we need be careful to write correct form of 
format-string and the input value-box.

the common format-string rule is:

-- type label

%c
    output char
%s 
    output string (const char*)
%d
    output number in decimal
%x
    hex number and lowercase
%X 
    hex number and uppercase
%u
    unsigned int
%z
    output size_t
%zu 
    output size_t with decimal format 
%p
    pointer, it always is hex
--
